// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, in which the software's purpose is defined and the requirements needed to achieve that goal are laid out."
const design = "This is the third step, during which the way a software will work is modeled. Some aspects of the design include architecture, UI, platform availability, programming, communication, and security."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, which involves the actual writing of the program."
const testing = "This is the fifth step, during which a program is tested before being made available to users."
const maintain = "This is the final step, during which a programmer is responsible for updating the code as needed to remedy new bugs in need of fixing."
